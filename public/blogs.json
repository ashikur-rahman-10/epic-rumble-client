        "question": "What is an access token and refresh token?",
        "answer": "An access token is a temporary credential used by a client to access protected resources on behalf of a user or application. A refresh token is a long-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. Access tokens should be stored securely in memory or short-lived storage mechanisms, such as in-memory cache. Refresh tokens should be stored securely in long-lived storage mechanisms, such as HTTP-only cookies or encrypted client-side storage."
